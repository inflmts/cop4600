 *   1. A query returns all available flight bookings from a source airport to

 *
 *   3. When a flight booking is purchased, the capacities of all flights in
 *	the booking should be decremented.
 *
 *   4. A booking either contains a single direct flight from the source
 *	airport to the destination airport, or two flights: one from the source
 *	airport to a connection airport, and a second from the connection
 *	airport to the destination airport. The second flight in a connection
 *	must depart at least 2 hours after the first flightâ€™s departure.
 *
 *   5. A query will only return bookings with connections when there are no
 *	direct flights from the source airport to the destination airport.
 *
 *   6. If multiple flight bookings are returned by the query, bookings should
 *	be ordered by departure time, with the earliest flight first. In the
 *	case that a booking is a connection, it is ordered solely based on the
 *	departure time of the earlier flight.
